    """Tests of decorators on handlers.
        It is worth noting that whereas Brighter has to create a mechanism to allow decorators on the target handler, Python
        already has a decorator syntax. As this maps well to the attributes used by Brighter to signal the decorators
        used to meet orthogonal concerns it is natural to just use Python's own decorator syntax in Brightside, over
        rolling up a bespoke mechanism. Indeed, the use of attributes and decorator classes in Brighter mirrors functionality avaailable
        to Pythoh via its decorator syntax
        This test suite is really about proving we can provide equivalent functionality
        We use Benjamin Hodgoson's Poll library, which is itself inspired by Polly, the library used by Brighter
