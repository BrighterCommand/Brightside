| Version  | 1.0.0.pre-  |
* Under Construction
* Allows you to consume messages raised in Paramore.Brighter.CommandProcessor in Python
* In essence, it competes with Celery, whose use of RPC over messaging creates coupling issues
* (Yes, it violates are discography based naming scheme, but given Monty Python and "Always look on the bright side of life, it was too tempting).
